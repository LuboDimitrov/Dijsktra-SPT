# Dijsktra-SPT
Program that allows you the calculate the Shortest Path Tree for a given node

To run it just clone this repo, compile and hit the run button on your IDE.

I would explain how Dijkstra's algorithm works but if you are reading this I take it you already know it

Test case:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A===|2|B;
    A===|1|C;
    A===|7|D;
    B===|3|D;
    B===|2|C;
    C===|5|D;
    C===|1|E;
    D===|2|E;
    D===|3|F;
    E===|4|F;
```
